| **Criteria**              | **Excellent (10 pts)** | **Good (8 pts)** | **Satisfactory (6 pts)** | **Needs Improvement (4 pts)** | **Unsatisfactory (2 pts)** |
|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Technical Content** (25%) | Demonstrates deep understanding of the topic, includes advanced concepts, and applies them accurately. | Covers major technical aspects correctly but lacks depth in some areas. | Covers basic concepts but lacks depth and some inaccuracies are present. | Lacks clarity in technical concepts, with significant errors. | Minimal technical content with major inaccuracies. |
| **Clarity & Organization** (20%) | Presentation is well-structured, logical, and easy to follow; smooth transitions. | Good structure, but minor lapses in flow or organization. | Somewhat organized but difficult to follow at times. | Poor organization, making it hard to understand. | No clear structure, difficult to follow. |
| **Use of Visual Aids** (15%) | Professional and clear slides/visuals that enhance understanding and complement the topic. | Good quality slides, but some minor issues in clarity or relevance. | Slides are somewhat clear, but lack engagement or organization. | Poorly designed slides or excessive text with little engagement. | No slides or visuals, or visuals that confuse rather than support. |
| **Presentation Skills** (15%) | Speaker is confident, maintains eye contact, and engages the audience effectively. | Good engagement but lacks confidence at times. | Some engagement, but limited eye contact or reliance on notes. | Lacks engagement, low energy, or heavily dependent on notes. | Poor engagement, monotone voice, and excessive reading from slides. |
