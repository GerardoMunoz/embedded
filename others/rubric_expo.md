4. **Backup Plan (Plan B):** An alternative approach if materials are unavailable.

## **Presentation Evaluation Criteria**

| **Criteria**              | **Excellent (10 pts)** | **Good (8 pts)** | **Satisfactory (6 pts)** | **Needs Improvement (4 pts)** | **Unsatisfactory (2 pts)** |
|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Technical Content** (20%) | Demonstrates deep understanding of Embedded Systems concepts, includes advanced analysis, and applies them accurately. | Covers major technical aspects correctly but lacks depth in some areas. | Covers basic concepts but lacks depth and some inaccuracies are present. | Lacks clarity in technical concepts, with significant errors. | Minimal technical content with major inaccuracies. |
| **Practical Activity** (20%) | The activity is innovative, well-planned, engaging, and directly related to the topic. | Activity is relevant and mostly engaging but could be improved. | Activity is somewhat related to the topic but lacks engagement or clarity. | Weakly planned activity with limited educational value. | No practical activity or completely irrelevant. |
| **Clarity & Organization** (15%) | Presentation is well-structured, logical, and easy to follow; smooth transitions. | Good structure, but minor lapses in flow or organization. | Somewhat organized but difficult to follow at times. | Poor organization, making it hard to understand. | No clear structure, difficult to follow. |
| **Use of Visual Aids** (10%) | Professional and clear slides/visuals that enhance understanding and complement the topic. | Good quality slides, but some minor issues in clarity or relevance. | Slides are somewhat clear, but lack engagement or organization. | Poorly designed slides or excessive text with little engagement. | No slides or visuals, or visuals that confuse rather than support. |
| **Presentation Skills** (10%) | Speaker is confident, maintains eye contact, and engages the audience effectively. | Good engagement but lacks confidence at times. | Some engagement, but limited eye contact or reliance on notes. | Lacks engagement, low energy, or heavily dependent on notes. | Poor engagement, monotone voice, and excessive reading from slides. |
