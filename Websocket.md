# REST, WebHook, JavaScript Methods and WebSocket

## 1. REST

* **REST (Representational State Transfer):** an **architectural style** for designing distributed systems.

* **REST is a set of best practices** that defines how to use HTTP consistently for clean, scalable APIs.

Without REST, you might use HTTP in an arbitrary way, for example:

```
POST /getUser?id=123
```

That *works* in HTTP, but it’s not RESTful design. In REST, this would be modeled as:

```
GET /users/123
```

---

👉 In summary: **REST doesn’t add anything “new” to HTTP, but establishes conventions and an architectural style to use HTTP consistently.**

* Example of a REST API:

  ```http
  GET https://api.server.com/sensors/temperature
  ```

  Response:

  ```json
  { "temp": 22.5, "unit": "C" }
  ```

* Normally, a REST API uses multiple HTTP methods (**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.**) to represent actions on resources, not just GET.

* Summary:

  * **REST → theory (principles).**
  * **RESTful API → an implementation that follows REST principles strictly.**
  * **REST API → a practical implementation (sometimes partial) of REST.**

### **Examples of Public REST APIs with GET**

#### Met.no (Norwegian Meteorological Institute)

* Official API also used by apps like Yr.no.
* Example forecast for Oslo:

  ```
  https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact?lat=59.91&lon=10.75
  ```

#### USGS Earthquake API

* Real-time seismic information.
* Example: last earthquakes M>4.5:

  ```
  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_day.geojson
  ```

## 2. WebHook
A webhook is just:

You tell the provider (via HTTP) the URL where you want to receive events.

The provider sends you HTTP requests (usually POST) whenever an event happens.

So the “subscription” step is usually an HTTP request you make to the provider’s API.

* **Event-driven communication mechanism.**
* Instead of the client polling the server, the server sends data **when an event occurs**.
* Used in:

  * Service integrations (e.g., GitHub → notification to a server on push).
  * IoT → a device can receive real-time alerts.
  * **Discord:** WebHooks allow external apps to send automated messages to a channel.
* General example:

  * Service A (sensor server) sends a POST to Service B’s URL when new data arrives.

  ```http
  POST /webhook HTTP/1.1
  Host: my-server.com
  Content-Type: application/json

  { "sensor": "temp", "value": 22.5 }
  ```

### WebHook as Pub/Sub Pattern

* A WebHook can be seen as a simple form of **Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe):**

  * **Publisher:** the server/service that generates the event.
  * **Subscriber:** the app exposing an endpoint that receives notifications.
* Differences vs. more complex Pub/Sub systems (e.g., MQTT, Kafka):

  * WebHook → direct HTTP communication between services.
  * Pub/Sub → uses a **broker** between publishers and subscribers.
* In IoT, WebHooks are useful for **event notifications**, while MQTT is better for **continuous data streams**.
* There isn’t a single universal standard HTTP message for subscribing to a webhook. It actually depends on the service you’re integrating with. But most providers follow some common patterns built on top of plain HTTP.




### Typical patterns

REST-style subscription
You send a POST request to the provider’s API, telling it your webhook URL:

POST /webhooks HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://myapp.com/webhook",
  "events": ["user.created", "user.deleted"]
}


Then the provider might answer with 201 Created and return the webhook ID.

Challenge/verification handshake
Many providers (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Stripe) send a verification request (often a GET or POST) to your webhook URL to confirm you control it.
Example (Stripe style):

POST https://myapp.com/webhook
{
  "type": "verification",
  "challenge": "abc123"
}


Your server must reply with that challenge token.

Manual configuration
Sometimes you don’t subscribe via HTTP at all—you go into the provider’s dashboard (UI), paste your webhook URL, and they handle the rest.

### Standards

There are some efforts at standardizing this:

WebSub (W3C)
 defines a publish/subscribe system over HTTP.

But in practice, most webhook systems are custom, with similar but slightly different subscription flows.




### WebHooks in Discord

* Discord provides a unique URL for each channel WebHook.
* Messages are always sent via **HTTP POST**.
* Example payload:

  ```http
  POST https://discord.com/api/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN
  Content-Type: application/json

  { "content": "Hello from my IoT app!" }
  ```
* Supports simple text messages, embeds, or more complex notifications.

## 3. JavaScript Methods for Communication

### fetch()

* Modern **JavaScript** function for making HTTP requests.
* Based on **Promises** → cleaner and easier than older alternatives.
* By default, `fetch()` uses **GET**, but it can be configured for **POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.**

### XMLHttpRequest (XHR)

* Older JavaScript API for HTTP requests.
* Foundation of the **AJAX** concept.
* More verbose and callback-based compared to `fetch()`.

### Other Methods

* **window\.location.reload()** → Reloads the current page.
* **HTML Forms** → Submitting a form sends data or reloads.
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** → One-way stream from server to browser.
* **window\.location.href = 'url'** → Redirects to another URL.

## 4. WebSocket

A **WebSocket** is a communication protocol that provides a **bidirectional, real-time** connection between a client (e.g., a browser) and a server. 

Unlike traditional HTTP, where the client always initiates communication, WebSockets allow **both sides to send messages at any time**.


###  Relationship with TCP and HTTP
- WebSockets run **on top of TCP**, ensuring reliable and ordered transmission.
- The connection starts as a **normal HTTP request**.
- Then, the client requests an upgrade with the headers:
  ```http
  Upgrade: websocket
  Connection: Upgrade
  ```
- If the server responds successfully, the protocol switches from HTTP to WebSocket on the same TCP channel.



###  Advantages over traditional HTTP
* **Real-time communication** without repeated polling.  
* **Lower latency** and less network overhead.  
* Perfect for **chats, online games, IoT, notifications, live dashboards**, etc.

### Usage in JavaScript (client side)

In the browser, you create a WebSocket with:
```js
let ws = new WebSocket("ws://server:port/");
```

### Main events:
- **`onopen`** → when the connection opens.
- **`onmessage`** → when a message is received from the server.
- **`onclose`** → when the connection closes.
- **`onerror`** → when an error occurs.

Example:
```js
ws.onopen = () => console.log("Connected ✅");
ws.onmessage = (e) => console.log("Message:", e.data);
ws.onclose = () => console.log("Disconnected ❌");
ws.onerror = (err) => console.error("Error:", err);

ws.send("Hello server!");
```



### Connection flow

1. Client → HTTP request with `Upgrade: websocket`.  
2. Server → responds with **101 Switching Protocols**.  
3. Connection established → both sides can send messages.  
4. Connection closed by client or server.


###  Real-world examples
- Real-time chats (WhatsApp Web, Slack).  
- Online multiplayer games.  
- Financial data streaming.  
- IoT: devices reporting live data.  
- Remote control applications.





### Example:

```javascript
import network

wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)

print("Connecting to WiFi...")

    time.sleep(0.5)
print("Connected:", wlan.ifconfig())

```

* Advantage over REST:

  * REST → stateless, one request → one response.
  * WebSocket → persistent, supports event-driven flows.
